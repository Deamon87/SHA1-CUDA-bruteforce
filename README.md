# SHA1-CUDA-bruteforce
A CUDA-based SHA-1 bruteforce application

A quick implemented application to see what is possible. I guess there is a lot of room for speed up.
The application was able to crack a 6-char long string on a given 95-char set within 3 hours (worst case input, graphic device: GeForce Quadro 6000).
