# SHA1-CUDA-bruteforce
CUDA implementation of a SHA1 bruteforcer

A cuda-based SHA-1 bruteforce application
A quick implemented application to see what is possible and what not. I guess there is a lot of room for speed up.
The application was able to crack a 6-char long string on a given 95-char set within 3 hours (worst case szenario, graphic device: GeForce Quadro 6000).
